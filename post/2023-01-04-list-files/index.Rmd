This is a cautionary tale about the base R function `list.files()`.
When you give it a vector of paths (which you totally can do), it **re-orders** the output alphabetically.
This screwed me over in a project I'm working on where I took file paths from a data frame, used them to `list.files()` and assumed (a sane assumption, I think) that the output would be in the same order.
In this case, I knew there was only one file per path, but I think I would have assumed this even if it was returning more than one file.

```{r}
tmp <- tempdir()
dir.create(file.path(tmp, "A"))
dir.create(file.path(tmp, "B"))
dir.create(file.path(tmp, "C"))
file.create(file.path(tmp, "A", "A.txt"))
file.create(file.path(tmp, "B", "B.txt"))
file.create(file.path(tmp, "C", "C.txt"))

file_list <- file.path(tmp, c("C", "A", "B"))
file_list #in order C, A, B

list.files(file_list, full.names = TRUE) #in order A, B, C!
```

So I was wrong, and it made all the work I did for the past several months somewhat wrong, but the good news is there is an easy fix.
The [`fs` package](https://fs.r-lib.org/) is the 'tidy' solution to working with files and file paths in R.
The `fs` alternative to `list.files()` is [`dir_ls()`](https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/dir_ls.html), and like many tidyverse equivalents of base R functions, it is better because it does *less*.
It won't re-order the outputs and it always assumes you want the full paths (not just the file name as is the default with `list.files()`).

```{r}
library(fs)
fs::dir_ls(file_list) #in correct order C, A, B
```

Needless to say, I'll be switching over to `fs::dir_ls()` for this project.
I'll also be spending some more time exploring the `fs` package and likely using it for all my file exploring and manipulation needs from now on.
