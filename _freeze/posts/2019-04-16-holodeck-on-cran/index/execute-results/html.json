Scott\ndate: '2019-04-16'\n# slug: holodeck-on-cran\ncategories:\n  - r\n  - multivariate-statistics\n---\n\n\nI woke up this morning to an email saying [my first R package](https://github.com/Aariq/holodeck), `holodeck`, was on it's way to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)!\nIt's a humble package, providing a framework for quickly slapping together test data with different degrees of correlation between variables and differentiation among levels of a categorical variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Example use of holodeck\n\nlibrary(holodeck)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndf <-\n  #make a categorical variable with 10 observations and 3 groups\n  sim_cat(n_obs = 10, n_groups = 3, name = \"Treatment\") %>% \n  #add 3 variables that covary\n  sim_covar(n_vars = 3, var = 1, cov = 0.5) %>% \n  #add 10 variables that don't covary, but discriminate levels of Treatment\n  group_by(Treatment) %>% \n  sim_discr(n_vars = 10, var = 1, cov = 0, group_means = c(-1, 0, 1)) %>% \n  #sprinkle in som NAs\n  sim_missing(prop = 0.02)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\"First package\" isn't entirely correct.\nThe functions in `holodeck` got their start in another [package](https://github.com/Aariq/chemhelper) that's really just for me.\nWhile working on a [manuscript](http://www.ericrscott.com/project/pls-ecology/) I ended up writing functions for simulating multivariate data.\nFrom the beginning, I planned to share code related to the manuscript when it (hopefully) is published, but my analysis code loaded my personal package that was only on my computer and included a bunch of other stuff that was probably only useful to me.\nAt [rstudio::conf19](http://www.ericrscott.com/2019/01/23/rstudio-conf-reflections/), I asked several atendees who worked in academic positions what I should do.\nThe answer I heard was as long as my functions *might* be useful to others, I should publish my package to CRAN, then just cite the published package in my manuscript.\n\nSo I pulled the relevant functions into their own standalone package, which is now called `holodeck`, and began working on refining, documenting, and testing those functions to get the package ready for CRAN submission.\nThe process of creating an R package and readying it for CRAN submission was more painless than I imagined!\nHere some of the resources I used:\n\n-   The [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html) package provides great tools for automating many things involved in package creation.\n-   The [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham was a great guideline.\n-   Writing tests with the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) package.\n-   I also had to learn a bit about [tidyeval](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/dplyr.html), because the functions I wrote were meant to work with `dplyr::group_by()`.\n\nI hope that others find my package useful, but even if no one else uses it, I'm happy I went through the process.\nIt was a great learning experience, and I'm excited about the possibility of publishing other packages in the future!\n",
