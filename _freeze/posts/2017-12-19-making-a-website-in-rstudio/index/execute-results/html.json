Scott\ndate: '2017-12-19'\n# slug: making-a-website-in-rstudio\n# draft: false\ncategories:\n  - r\n  - rmarkdown\n  - blogdown\n---\n\n\nI've always thought I should eventually have a professional website for job hunting, but recently I've realized that it would be nice to have somewhere to collect my thoughts and contributions all in one place.\nBefore having a website of my own, I generally shared updates and thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeafyEricScott) and on [other people's blogs](#blogs), which I will still continue to do, but having everything I do in one place seems like a good idea.\nI kept putting off making a website until I was recently encouraged by a combination of envy of my [officemate's awesome looking website](https://www.rachaelebonoan.com/), and learning that one could make a website using R Studio and the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package.\nI just spent a semester learning a ton about R Markdown, the file type blogdown uses to construct websites, for a [biostatistics course](https://github.com/Aariq/biostats-recitation) I was teaching, so I figured using R Markdown to make a website would be relatively easy.\nFortunately, I was correct!\nI spent about 3-4 work days initially getting this website working and customized, and it was relatively painless.\nCompared to, say WordPress, the impressiveness-to-effort ratio is much higher, in my opinion.\n\n## Getting started with Blogdown\n\nBasically blogdown builds a website from a series of Markdown or R Markdown documents.\nMarkdown and the more R-specific version, R Markdown, are really simple languages for creating formatted HTML documents.\nFor example, you can create headers like the one at the start of this paragraph simply by adding different numbers of \"\\#\", and turn a word into a link with square brackets followed by a URL.\nWhen the Markdown is converted to HTML, those special characters get converted into the relevant HTML code.\nBlogdown adds some features to R Studio that make it easier to import themes to help you get started, write new blog posts, and view changes to your website \"live.\"\n\nThe [tutorial for blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html) is great, but I found that choosing a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) early on was important, because a lot of what I needed to learn and figure out was specific to the theme.\nIn fact, using blogdown wasn't really as helpful as I thought for editing the theme I chose, as the example pages in the theme were written in a different format (Markdown with TOML headers) than the default for a new blogdown post (R Markdown with YAML header).\nThat being said, the example Markdown documents that came with the theme were well annotated and for the most part all I had to do was fiddle around with values and add my own text and images.\n\n## Building and Hosting a website\n\nI decided to go with blogdown's recommendation to build and host my website using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\nThe tutorials on Netlify are very jargon-y and I got basically nothing out of them.\nFortunately, the [chapter on Netlify](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html) in the blogdown book was very helpful.\nNetlify builds your website from a GitHub repository containing all the Markdown or R Markdown files you've created.\nFortunately, I had just recently figured out (after *much* failure) how to link GitHub to R Studio thanks to [Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com/), so it was just a matter of pushing updates to my website to GitHub and following the blogdown tutorial to build the website.\n\n## Want to make a website? Just try it!\n\nAll of this was completely free, and if you have *some* knowledge of R Markdown it is super easy to get started.\nEven if you've never used R Markdown, it's not hard to learn.\nDepending on the theme you choose, you could get a website up and running in a day or two easily.\nFeel free to check out the [source documents](https://github.com/Aariq/my-website) for this website.\nI think you'll find that they are not as intimidating as you might think!\n",
