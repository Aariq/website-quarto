# Biography

I'm a Scientific Programmer & Educator at [The University of Arizona](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu).
I collaborate with researchers in the College of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences on statistics, data wrangling, and data visualization.
The workshops I teach are on a variety of beginner and intermediate data science topics, typically in R.
My background is in plant chemical ecology, plant--insect interactions, and plant demography.
I'm also a huge tea geek and occasionally do tea science communication.
