# Biography

I'm a scientific programmer & educator with a background in ecology and statistics.
I work with researchers to manage and analyze data, automate workflows, create R packages, and build interactive web apps to help their science make an impact.
I teach workshops and mentor researchers on a variety of beginner and intermediate data science topics.
I have a passion for reproducible and open science and enjoy work that makes science more accessible.
My background is in plant chemical ecology, plant--insect interactions, and plant demography.
I'm also a huge tea geek and occasionally do tea science communication.
