I'm working with Jeremy Weiss at the University of Arizona Cooperative Extension to improve data access and quality for the Arizona Meterological Network (AZMet).
I've created an [R package](https://github.com/uace-azmet/azmetr) to access weather data from the AZMet API in R, developed a novel [forecast-based QA pipeline](https://github.com/uace-azmet/azmet-forecast-qa), and a [QA dashboard](https://github.com/uace-azmet/azmet-qa-dashboard) with various data validations.
