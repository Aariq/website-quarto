The `geotargets` package extends the `targets` package to work with geospatial R packages such as `terra`, `stars`, and `sf`.
It is being developed in collaboration with [Nicholas Tierney](https://github.com/njtierney) with financial support from the [R Consortium](http://r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals).
