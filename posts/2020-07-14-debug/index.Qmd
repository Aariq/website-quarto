If you've ever tried to look "under the hood" of an R function, you know that sometimes it can be tricky to figure out what's going on, especially if you use R more as a statistical tool than as a programming language.
Sometimes you really need to take a look at what a function is doing behind the scenes though.
Using the `debug()` function with R and R Studio is a great way to do this, but it can be really intimidating.
I made a short demo to show you how to get started with using `debug()` to peer into the inner workings of R functions.
