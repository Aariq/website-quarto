The [bumbl package](https://github.com/Aariq/bumbl) implements a model for bumblebee colony growth described in Crone and Williams 2019.
It models colony growth as having a change point at some time, tau, where the colony switches from growth and worker production to gyne production.
The `bumbl()` function applies this model to data from multiple colonies, allowing for each colony to have it's own tau and returns the original data augmented with coefficients from the changepoint model.
